 * Routine for doing I/O (reads or writes) on the free block bitmap.

 * might or might not be a worthwhile optimization. Similarly, storing
 * the bitmap in the buffer cache might or might not be a worthwhile
 * optimization. (But that would require a total rewrite of the way
 * it's handled, so not now.)
 *
 * The free block bitmap consists of SFS_BITBLOCKS 512-byte sectors of
 * bits, one bit for each sector on the filesystem. The number of
 * blocks in the bitmap is thus rounded up to the nearest multiple of
 * 512*8 = 4096. (This rounded number is SFS_BITMAPSIZE.) This means
 * that the bitmap will (in general) contain space for some number of
 * invalid sectors that are actually beyond the end of the disk
 * device. This is ok. These sectors are supposed to be marked "in
 * use" by mksfs and never get marked "free".
 *
 * The sectors used by the superblock and the bitmap itself are
 * likewise marked in use by mksfs.
